    Offers detailed information about current and historical (2 years old) vehicle listings on the mobile.de platform. 
    This includes data such as: basic ad details (id, version, site, source channel, quality status, lifecycle status, visibility settings), 
    vehicle details (make, model, price, technical specs like mileage, fuel type, emissions), seller/dealer information (contact details, company info, location),
    media assets (images, videos), additional ad features (highlights, financing options, delivery options), pricing history, online buying eligibility status, etc.

    It supports analyses of all the active vehicle listings on our platform over the last 2 years. 
    This comprehensive data can be useful for various analytic purposes such as: powering the search and browsing experience for users, 
    generating analytics and insights on listing trends, pricing, popular models etc, enabling additional product features like financing, delivery logistics etc., 
    storing an audit trail of all listing updates and changes. 

  limitation: > 
    Only last 2 years of data is available since that's the retention period for GDPR. 
    If a dealer deletes an add, the VIN will be removed from all occurences for that ad (due to GDPR restrictions).
    Data is available only on the day after it's produced.
