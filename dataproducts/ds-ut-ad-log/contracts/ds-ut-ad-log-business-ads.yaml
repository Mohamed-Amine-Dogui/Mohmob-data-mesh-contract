    The event is derived from ad-log event which is triggered every time an ad in mobile.de is created, updated, re-published or deleted.
    The service that produces events consumed to produce this output port's data is https://github.es.ecg.tools/mobile-de/mdp-kafka-business-ads-filter.
    Comments

    The ad_log_business_ads table contains records whenever seller ads are created/updated, in order to estimate how long the ad stayed on our website, 
    we need to check when the ad is deleted in the table ad_log_deleted_ads, hence the union in the example query. 
    The result of the query is later used to generate a daily history on when the add existed on our platform and when it disappeared. 
    Check the BigQuery BI Layer for more information.

    Important columns: 
    date: It is the event date of when the add has been modified on our platform.
    id: It is the unique identifier of the add.
    lifecycleStatus: It indicates the current status of the add on our platform, for exp: ACTIVE, ON_HOLD, REMOVED. EXPIRED.
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id, customerid_hash, version) statement should be equal to 1 to get the latest status of the add and remove any misleading de-duplications.
